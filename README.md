An ImGui replacement for FlyText in Final Fantasy XIV.

# Prior Art

Thank you to the creators & maintainers of [FlyTextFilter][1] and [DamageInfo][2] for providing inspiration and an in-code reference implementation for where to begin. It would literally not have been possible for me to begin work on this without their efforts.

# Attribution

Additionally, thank you to the creators & maintainers of [DelvUI][4] and [XIVComboExpanded][3] for providing additional reference material and implementation details that were lost on me from the official documentation sources. Similar to the aforementioned prior art, these plugins were instrumental in providing me a basis for which I could begin.
